## ðŸš€ Quick Start (WIP)
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) v1.5.1 as a dependency manager. Check out Poetry's [documentation on how to install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) on your system before proceeding.

1. Install Poetry v1.5.1 (see above)
2. Create and activate a new virtual env (e.g `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`)
3. Tell Poetry to use the virtualenv python environment (poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true)
4. Install requirements: `poetry install`

This shall install all requirements for running the project.
